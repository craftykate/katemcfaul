      <h4>Guest Lecturer at Benicia High School</h4>
      <p>
        I regularly combine my love for programming with my passion for teaching
        and my desire to give back to my community and help encourage the next
        generation of coders. Every year I do a three day course at the local
        high school and teach the AP Computer Science kids how to build a
        portfolio website from scratch. I've heard they love my unit! I also
        help out with the robotics class when they need advice or an extra hand.{' '}

      <h4>Girls Who Code Club Leader</h4>
      <p>
        A few years ago no girls signed up for Intro to Programming at the high
        school (zero girls!) so I started a Girls Who Code club at the middle
        school to show girls how fun and awesome programming and robotics are
        and hopefully encourage more girls to take an interest. Girls make
        awesome programmers! My girls were interested in combining art with
        robotics and I really enjoyed coming up with projects for us to do.{' '}
