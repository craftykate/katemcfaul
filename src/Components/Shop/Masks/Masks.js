          I 3D print these fabulous elastic stoppers using flexible filament
          that make it very easy to adjust your masks. I love them the most when
          I'm putting on my toddler's mask - even when he's on the move I can
          easily put his mask on and adjust it. If I'm wearing a hat or have my
          hair in a ponytail it's nice to slide the stopper up and down instead
          of having to untie and retie the elastic.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Price: $1 per mask set.</strong>

            (These can be washed, I wash mine all the time, but they don't like
            high heat. They can probably stand up to 150Â°F, so they can probably
            go in a dryer on low, but I haven't tested that. I air dry all our
            masks to extend the life of the masks, wires, elastic and stoppers.)

            <strong>Note about stock:</strong> I used to maintain in stock a
            handful of masks in each size, but almost ran out completely after a
            large amount of orders at the start of the 2021 school year. I know
            some people (and especially their kids!) depend on my masks, so I've
            been trying to make enough now for occasional orders, so message me
            to get on the list for my next batch.

          I am now offering packs of <strong>extra N95 filters</strong>{' '}
          exclusively for customers who have bought my masks! Filters go in the
          masks with the fuzzier side facing away from your face.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Price: Each pack is $5 for 4 filters</strong>, and are limited
          to three packs for each mask set previously purchased. You do not have
          to order the extra filters at the same time as the masks.

            (I recommend checking with the CDC on the latest guidance for
            cleaning and sanitizing your PPE. In our house, we remove the
            filters and quarantine them for five days, and wash the masks with
            the regular laundry. You can iron the masks after washing if you
            like - but I usually don't, who has time for that - then I put a
            post-quarantine filter back in. I also write our initials with
            permanent marker on a corner of each filter so I can easily match
            filters to masks.)
