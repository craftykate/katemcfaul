          My scrubbies are back, and this time they come in a set of three! Each
          set includes a super scouring scrubby, an all-purpose scrubby, and a
          cotton scrubby . They are machine washable so you can use them for a
          long time. They each have a built-in loop to hang them from a hook and
          all are hand-knit by me, using two strands of yarn for durability.
          They work amazingly well, they're eco-friendly, and they're cute, too!

          I've been making my own sponges for many years. These last a lot
          longer than store-bought sponges, they work so much better and I love
          the way they look.

          Price: $20 for each set. Sets come in red, yellow, green, teal and
          blue, tied together with a little bow and a cute tag with the scrubby
          descriptions on the back. These make cute gifts!

          Super Scouring Scrubby Made from one strand fabulous cotton scrubby
          yarn and one strand quick-drying acrylic yarn for extra strength, this
          scrubby is great for those really tough spots. Use on dishes, carpet
          stains, soap scum in the shower, etc.

          All-Purpose Dish Scrubby I've been making a version of this scrubby
          for over 10 years. Acrylic closely mimics the properties of
          microfiber, and these scrubbies are made with two strands of it,
          making them incredibly effective and durable. And they are safe for
          non-stick pans. I have one in my bathroom and use it to clean my
          make-up brushes, and use another one for dusting.

          I first use new sponges for dishes, then as they get a little less
          clean over time I use them on counters and tables and then when they
          are ready to be retired I'll use them to scrub out the cat litter box
          or a garbage can and throw them out. Each sponge has a lot of life in
          it!

          100% Cotton Counter Scrubby The cotton scrubby rounds out the set
          nicely. Cotton is a more absorbent fiber so these are great for
          counters and tables, but they are so durable they also do a great job
          scrubbing away tough spots. And because they are all cotton I even use
          one to wash my face!
