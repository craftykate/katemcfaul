          Features: a removable N95 filter that fits in an inner pocket so you
          can sub out your own filter if you want or remove it altogether;
          removable, flexible wire across the nose for a snug fit; adjustable,
          stretchy ties that tie behind the head (and don't pinch your hair like
          regular elastic) and go through side channels so you can sub out your
          own ties or cut them down to make ear loops; full-coverage fit - wide
          enough across the face and come in under the chin to reduce gaps; made
          from high-quality, tight-weave, 100% cotton quilter's fabric.

        <p>
          I worked hard to come up with a mask that I felt comfortable sending
          my own family out with, made from the best materials I could find.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sizes: Adult, Big Kid (~8yrs to adult), Little Kid (~4yrs to ~10yrs)
          and Itty Bitty (~2yrs to ~5yrs). The boys pictured are wearing Big
          Kid, Little Kid and Adult. Sizing is approximate and there's plenty of
          overlap in ages each mask can fit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Price: The masks come in a set of two coordinating masks. Each
          two-pack is $20. The pictures below show the two masks that come in
          each pack. Stoppers add $1 per set. Extra filter packs are $5 for 4
          filters.

      <Card title='Extra Filters'>
        <p>
          I am now offering packs of extra N95 filters exclusively for customers
          who have bought my masks! Filters go in the masks with the fuzzier
          side facing away from your face.
        </p>
        <p>
          Price: Each pack is $5 for 4 filters, and are limited to three packs
          for each mask set previously purchased. You do not have to order the
          extra filters at the same time as the masks.
        </p>
        <p>
          (I recommend checking with the CDC on the latest guidance for cleaning
          and sanitizing your PPE. In our house, we remove the filters and
          quarantine them for five days, and wash the masks with the regular
          laundry. You can iron the masks after washing if you like - but I
          usually don't, who has time for that - then I put a post-quarantine
          filter back in. I also write our initials with permanent marker on a
          corner of each filter so I can easily match filters to masks. )
        </p>

      <Card title='Elastic Stoppers'>
        <p>
          I 3D print these fabulous elastic stoppers using flexible filament
          that make it very easy to adjust your masks. I love them the most when
          I'm putting on my toddler's mask - even when he's on the move I can
          easily put his mask on and adjust it. If I'm wearing a hat or have my
          hair in a ponytail it's nice to slide the stopper up and down instead
          of having to untie and retie the elastic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Price: These are an optional addition and will add $1 per mask set.
        </p>
        <p>
          (These can be washed, I wash mine all the time, but they don't like
          high heat. They can probably stand up to 150Â°F, so they can probably
          go in a dryer on low, but I haven't tested that. I air dry all our
          masks to extend the life of the masks, wires, elastic and stoppers.)
